## 🎮 Game Project
Welcome to my MiniGames subfolder.
I'm learning to code and trying to  make a game.
If you want to play, you can click  the MiniGames subfolder. Thank you.
I've made a game for example :GuessTheNumber

## 📜 Game Rules
For GuessTheNumber the rules are:
- The computer chooses a number randomly
- You have to guess it within 60 seconds
- Every wrong guess, the score is reduced and lives are reduced
- The highest score will be saved to the `highscore.txt` file

## 🕹️ How to Run
